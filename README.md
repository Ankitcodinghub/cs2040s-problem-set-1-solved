Problem Set 1

Week 1: A nice simple introduction to CS2040S‚Ä¶

Overview. You have two basic tasks this week.

‚Ä¢ Your first task this week is to set up your environment for writing programs in CS2040S. By the end of this problem set, you should be able to write simple Java programs.

‚Ä¢ Your second task is to implement a linear feedback shift register. This is a simple data structure that can be used as part of a simple encryption schemes, or as a part of a pseudorandom number generator.

For each problem, upload the Java files to Coursemology as individual files, and write any textual answers in the text box.

Problem 1. (Getting up and running)

In CS2040S, we will be writing programs in Java. We will be using IntelliJ as our Integrated Development Environment (IDE). IntelliJ is available as an open-source (Apache 2.0) Community version that has all the functionality needed for CS2040S, and runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux. It contains useful editing, debugging, and profiling tools. You can download it at:

https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/

IMPORTANT NOTE: It is not explicitly mentioned in the video guide, but the ‚ÄúLanguage level‚Äù setting must be set to ‚ÄúSDK Default‚Äù. Otherwise, you might encounter the following error:

Java: error: release version x not supported

Problem 1.a. Start IntelliJ and create a new Java project called ps1 for this problem. Choose Java version 11.0.17 for Project SDK. If you do not have the SDK, download it here. You will need to create an Oracle account in order to download it. Inside the src folder, create a new Java class called Main.java (the name is case sensitive!). Within this class, create the following method:

static int MysteryFunction(int argA, int argB) { int c = 1; int d = argA; int e = argB; while (e &gt; 0) { if (2 * (e / 2) != e) { c = c * d;

}

d = d * d; e = e / 2;

} return c;

}

Also, create the following main function:

public static void main(String args[]) { int output = MysteryFunction(5, 5);

System.out.printf(‚ÄúThe answer is: ‚Äù + output + ‚Äú.‚Äù);

}

Run your program. What is the answer output in your solution?

Problem 1.b. What is MysteryFunction calculating? If you try a few examples, you might be able to guess the answer.

‚Ä¢ your name (as you prefer to be called),

‚Ä¢ your favourite algorithm or your favourite joke,

‚Ä¢ a few sentences of additional information on your background and who you are (but nothing private that you would want kept secret from the rest of the class),

‚Ä¢ the answer(s) to the previous parts, i.e. Problems 1.a and 1.b.

This HelloWorld.java file is the only file that you should submit for Problem 1.

Problem 2. Linear Feedback Shift Register

A shift register is an array of bits that supports a shift operation which moves every bit one slot to the left. For example, below is an example of a shift register initially containing the seed ‚Äú10101111‚Äù. It is shifted twice. Each time it is shifted, the most significant bit is dropped, every other bit is moved one place to the left, and the least significant bit is replaced with a ‚Äò0‚Äô. Notice that after it is shifted 8 times, the shift register will be all zeros.

Note: In the usual convention, the most significant bit is written as the leftmost bit.

A linear feedback shift register is a special type of shift register that, instead of setting the least significant bit to zero, updates the least significant bit with some linear function of the other bits. That is, when a shift operation occurs, it feeds back some information into the least significant bit. We will build a linear feedback shift register based on the exclusive-or (XOR) function. (In Java, (a^b) calculates the XOR of a and b.)

Our linear feedback shift register takes two parameters: a size and a tap. The size refers to the number of bits. The tap refers to one of the bits and must be between 0 and size‚àí1 (inclusive). size specifies number of bits the register should be dealing with and tap specifies which bit (starting from the least significant bit) is going to used in the XOR operation.

Every time a shift operation occurs, the following four things happen:

1. The feedback bit is calculated as the XOR of the most significant bit and the tap bit.

2. The most significant bit is dropped.

3. Every bit is moved one slot to the left.

4. The least significant bit is set to the feedback bit.

Here are two examples of a linear feedback shift register in action. In both cases, the size is 8 and the tap is 4 (which is the 5th least significant bit, i.e., if the tap was 0, then we would XOR with least significant bit).

Download ps1.zip. Inside, you will find the relevant files that you require to complete the following tasks. Open the code folder using IntelliJ (the folder containing mystery.bmp) and configure Project SDK to be Java version 11.0.17.

Problem 2.a. Implement a linear feedback shift register called ShiftRegister that implements the ILFShiftRegister interface:

public interface ILFShiftRegister { void setSeed(int[] seed); int shift(); int generate(int k);

}

The interface requires that the following methods be supported:

‚Ä¢ void setSeed(int[] seed): Sets the shift register to the specified initial seed. The initial seed is specified as an array of 0‚Äôs and 1‚Äôs (represented as integers). If the seed contains any other value, that is an error. (Recall that the seed is the initial set of bits stored in the shift register.)

IMPORTANT NOTE: The given input array seed will be such that the least significant bit is on index 0 of the integer array. For example, if the actual seed is 00101, then it will be given as {1,0,1,0,0} in the program.

‚Ä¢ int shift(): Executes one shift step and returns the least significant bit of the resulting register.

‚Ä¢ int generate(int k): Extracts k bits from the shift register. It executes the shift operation k times, saving the k bits returned. It then converts these k bits from binary into an integer. For example: if generate is called with a value of 3, then it calls shift 3 times. If the shift operations return 1 and then 1 and then 0, then generate returns the value 6 (i.e., ‚Äú110‚Äù in binary).

Your implementation should also support the following constructor:

‚Ä¢ ShiftRegister(int size, int tap)

This constructor initializes the shift register with its size and with the appropriate tap. Submit your implementation.

The given template code includes a toDecimal method which you can implement if you think it is useful. Otherwise, it can be ignored if you do not intend on using it.

Problem 2.b. Test your code with a variety of test cases. Make sure to test the corner cases (e.g., when the shift-register has size 1, etc.). Here are two sample test cases to use. The first tests the shift functionality, while the second tests the generate functionality. Test 1: seed = ‚Äò101111010‚Äô, tap = 7

int[] array = new int[] {0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1};

ShiftRegister shifter = new ShiftRegister(9, 7); shifter.setSeed(array);

for (int i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++) { int j = shifter.shift(); System.out.print(j);

}

This code should produce the following output:

1100011110

Test 2: seed = ‚Äò101111010‚Äô, tap = 7

int[] array = new int[] {0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1};

ShiftRegister shifter = new ShiftRegister(9, 7); shifter.setSeed(array);

for (int i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++) {

int j = shifter.generate(3); System.out.println(j);

}

This code should produce the following output:

6

1

7

2

2

1

6

6

2

3

IMPORTANT NOTE: Please refer to the set-up video for instructions on setting up JUnit.

Look at the last test: it is testing what happens when the seed is larger than the specified register. Explain what you think a proper response is to this erroneous situation, and what is the right way to test this case? (We will cover error handling later in the semester.) Submit your answer as in a comment in ShiftRegisterTest.java.

Problem 2.c. Think about how you might use a shift register to perform a simple encryption scheme. (Hint: initially, the seed of the shift register should be set to your ‚Äúpassword.‚Äù) How would you encrypt a text file? How would you encrypt an image?

The two released classes ImageEncode.java and SimpleImage.java implement a simple encryption/decryption scheme using a shift register. You will need to add a couple lines of code to ImageEncode.java so that it properly uses your shift register. To decode the picture, use the following ‚Äúcode‚Äù:

‚Ä¢ Tap: 7

‚Ä¢ Seed: 0111011001011

If your shift register works correctly, you should then be able to decode the included mystery picture. Who is it a picture of? (The only thing you are required to submit for this part is an identification of the decoded picture.)

Problem 2.d. (Extra, for those who are interested) Think of the output of a linear feedback shift register as the sequence of 0‚Äôs and 1‚Äôs that you get if you call getBit() after each shift. A linear feedback shift register is only useful for encryption if the resulting output sequence does not repeat very often. Experiment with how many times a shift register has to be shifted in order to cause the output pattern to repeat. Are all taps equally good?

Also, notice that a short binary password will not provide very good security. Optionally write a modified version that takes a text string (such as, ‚ÄúTheCowJumpedOverTheMoon‚Äù) and converts it to a (long) binary string to use as a seed for a shift register.

Another use of linear feedback shift registers is to generate pseudorandom numbers. One basic property of a pseudorandom number generator is that it outputs roughly the same number of 0‚Äôs as 1‚Äôs. Is that true of your linear feedback shift register?

This is an open ended question, feel free to submit anything that you think is appropriate with the relevant explanations.

Hints for question 2:

Why does it compile on my machine, but not on Coursemology? Coursemology fails if there are any non-ASCII characters in your file. Please ensure your file is only ASCII.

Do I need to comment my code? Yes. Be sure to write a comment explaining: the purpose of each class instance variable, and the purpose/workings of each method. You should also explain any critical steps in your code.

What data structure should I use to store the current value of the shift register? One of the advantages of encapsulation is that you can store the value of the register in any way that you want. For simplicity, we recommend that you use an array of integers (as is passed to setSeed). However, if you want to optimize the running time of the shift operation, there are more efficient solutions. Implement the best solution you can!

For generate, how do I convert the bits produced by shift into an integer? Begin with a variable v set to zero. Every time you get a new bit from shift, multiply v by two, and add the new bit (either 0 or 1). The final result will be the integer representation of the bits.

How do I create a variable to store the array of integers in the register when I don‚Äôt know its size? Declare it simply as an array of integers: int[] intArray. Then, initialize it in the constructor once you have learned the correct size.

For Test 2, my first call to generate produces the value 3 instead of the value 6. You are interpreting the bits in the wrong order. Notice that the binary string ‚Äò110‚Äô is 6, while the binary string ‚Äò011‚Äô is 3.

I get an ArrayOutOfBounds error (or a NullPointerException). Did you remember to initialize all your class instance variables?

When I try to run ShiftRegisterTest, it does not execute properly. Perhaps it asks if you want to run an Ant build? Perhaps it asks something else strange. Make sure that you have the JUnit package properly installed by adding a new JUnit test to your project. (You can do this under File‚ÜíNew‚ÜíJUnit test.) This ensures that IntelliJ is properly set up to run tests. Alternatively, you can check that the libraries are there. Go to Project‚ÜíProperties, then look in the section Java Build Path‚ÜíLibraries. You should see two entries: JRE and JUnit. If JUnit is not there, click add library and choose JUnit.

I am getting an error that says that each interface/class must be defined in its own file. Yes. In Java, each interface or class has to be in its own file, and the name of the file should match the name of the class (with the addition of the .java extension).

Where should I put the mystery file? Put it in the folder that contains the src folder, i.e., the project‚Äôs root folder.

I placed the mystery file in the src folder but the output is a blank window. What do I do? In the main function of Main.java, use the full path to the mystery file instead, i.e. /path/to/mystery.bmp instead of mystery.bmp.

How should I debug my program, when I cannot see the internal state of my object? Wouldn‚Äôt it be nice if you could just type System.out.println(shifter) and have it print out the value of the shift register? In fact, you can if you implement:

public String toString()

This method should convert the value of the register into a string and return it. Then, you can modify your test code to include:

System.out.println(shifter + ‚Äù ‚Äù + j); and you will get the following output for the first test:

011110101 1

111101011 1

111010110 0

110101100 0

101011000 0

010110001 1

101100011 1

011000111 1

110001111 1

100011110 0
